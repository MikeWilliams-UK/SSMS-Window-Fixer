# SSMS-Window-Fixer
Reposition SQL Server Management Studio dialog windows

This application was written becuase I got fed up with SSMS and Visual Studio dialogues being presented off screen when I had my laptop and two monitors set up in a T formation as shown below.

In this scenario some dialogues presented themselves in the piece of no man's land (dead areas) to the left or right of the laptop monitor below the auxiliary monitors, thus were inaccessible.

The magic key chord to move windows was ineffective in moving these dialogues.
